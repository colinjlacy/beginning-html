		<p>Other than stepping into the boxing ring for some sparring a few times a month, I fit just about every stereotype of a standard web-developer.  I'm addicted to coffee, drive a Civic, and have a well thought-out argument for why Battlestar is far superior to both Star Wars and Star Trek.  I'm married with two dogs and live in Gretna, LA - just accross the Mississippi River from New Orleans.</p>
